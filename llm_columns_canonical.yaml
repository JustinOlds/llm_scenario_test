# Canonical YAML Configuration for Location Insights Schema Discovery
# Last updated: 2025-07-17
#
# IMPORTANT: This config is an ENRICHMENT LAYER for data-driven schema discovery.
# The schema manager MUST first extract fields, types, and sample values directly from data.
# This config provides business context that cannot be inferred from data alone.
#
# Primary uses of this config:
# 1. Provide business purpose, importance ratings, and semantic tags for fields
# 2. Define question types and field relationships
# 3. Specify which columns to exclude (narrative fields, IDs, labels)
# 4. Set truncation tolerance parameters
#
# Sample values in this config are FALLBACKS ONLY - actual data samples must be preferred.

# Step prompts for LLM pipeline - providing guidance for each step
step_prompts:
  # Schema discovery (Step 0) - runs at startup to profile data assets
  schema_discovery:
    system: |
      You are an expert data profiler for retail analytics. Create a comprehensive schema intelligence report
      from the provided data columns. Focus on identifying question types that can be answered with this data.
      Assign business purpose and importance ratings to fields based on their analytical value.
    output_format: |
      {
        "schema_version": "2.0",
        "data_source": "location_data.csv",
        "fields_detected": <count>,
        "sample_fields": [ { "name": "...", "type": "...", "sample": "..." } ],
        "field_importance": { "high": <count>, "medium": <count>, "low": <count> },
        "business_purposes": { "performance": <count>, "health": <count>, "recommendations": <count>, "customers": <count>, "other": <count> },
        "question_types_supported": [ "sales_performance", "location_health", ... ]
      }
    context_guidance: |
      - Assign importance ratings (high/medium/low) based on business relevance
      - Categorize fields by business purpose (performance, health, recommendations, etc.)
      - Identify question types the schema can support based on available fields
      - Exclude narrative and JSON fields from analysis
      - Extract sample values that represent typical data distributions
      - Surface metrics and continuous fields for sorting and filtering operations

  # Classification (Step 1) - classifies user question into known types
  classification:
    system: |
      You are a retail analytics assistant for location data. Classify the user's question into a known type
      if possible (see 'question_types'). If the question doesn't match a known type, output the most relevant
      filtering parameters (column names and values) that could be used to select appropriate location data.
      Always use the available schema and field descriptions for reference. Data is reported weekly.
    user: |
      Question: {question}
      Available schema columns: {schema_columns}
      Field descriptions: {field_descriptions}
    output_format: |
      {
        "question_type": "<type or 'custom'>",
        "filter_column": "<column or null>",
        "filter_value": "<value or null>",
        "sort_column": "<column or null>",
        "sort_order": "<asc/desc or null>"
      }
    context_guidance: |
      - Only use columns present in the provided schema
      - If no known type, propose the most relevant filter(s) and sort(s) based on the question and schema
      - Data is weekly, so time context is important (see REPORT_WEEK)
      - Output must be machine-readable JSON

  # Context selection (Step 2) - selects relevant data based on classification
  context_selection:
    system: |
      Given the classification result and filtering parameters, select the most relevant data rows and columns
      for the question. Confirm or refine the filtering parameters. If no known type, use the custom filter parameters
      from the previous step. Always reference the schema and field descriptions. Data is reported weekly.
    user: |
      Question type: {question_type}
      Filter column: {filter_column}
      Filter value: {filter_value}
      Schema: {schema_columns}
      Data sample: {data_sample}
      Field descriptions: {field_descriptions}
    output_format: |
      {
        "selected_locations": [ ... ],
        "context_columns": [ ... ],
        "applied_filters": {
          "filter_column": "<column>",
          "filter_value": "<value>"
        }
      }
    context_guidance: |
      - Use only columns and values present in the schema and data sample
      - Output must include the actual filter(s) used for row selection
      - Data is at weekly granularity (REPORT_WEEK)
      - Output must be machine-readable JSON

  # Answer generation (Step 3) - generates final answer based on context
  answer_generation:
    system: |
      Generate a concise, actionable business answer using ONLY the provided context, schema, and question.
      Reference the schema for column meanings. Do not invent data. Data is reported weekly.
      
      Focus on highlighting the most important insights, trends, and recommendations based on the data.
      If the context includes multiple locations, prioritize those with the highest LLM_PRIORITY_SCORE
      or those that match the specified filter conditions most closely.
      
      Include specific metrics, percentages, or values to support your answer, but keep the overall
      response concise and business-focused.

        "suggested_followup_questions": ["How do these locations compare to last month?", ...]
      }
    context_guidance: |
      - Use only the provided context and schema
      - Reference field descriptions for all columns
      - Data is weekly; clarify time context in the answer if relevant
      - Output must be a string answer, with supporting previews as needed
